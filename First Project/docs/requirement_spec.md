#Requirement specification
From the very beginning, our company has stored tasks within the company on paper and excel.
Respectively, the employees of the company were able to view the tasks assigned to them through this, but this is not a very efficient solution, because the employees have to somehow
send a paper-based version or email to excel.The problem with excel is
that the user must find out from the table which task belongs to them.
