# Requirement specification

## Overview
The employer can create tasks which he/she entrusts employees. Goal of the application is that the employees can see which tasks they have to do. The application uses android system which every user can use via the phone.
They see what task they have to do also who untrusted them with the job. Furthermore they can see when is the deadline date. It is good because the employer can monitor that what are each employees are doing.

## Current situation
From the very beginning, our company has stored tasks within the company on paper and excel.
Respectively, the employees of the company were able to view the tasks assigned to them through this, but this is not a very efficient solution, because the employees have to somehow
send a paper-based version or email to excel.The problem with excel is
that the user must find out from the table which task belongs to them.
Or you need to make a separate excel spreadsheet for each user which is not very practical.

## Dream System
The application is intended to replace the current system with a more structured and traceable system.  Application is avaible on Android mobilphones.
The application has a registration interface, where employees and employers can register to the application, and they have different privileges.
