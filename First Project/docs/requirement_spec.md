# Requirement specification

## Current situation
From the very beginning, our company has stored tasks within the company on paper and excel.
Respectively, the employees of the company were able to view the tasks assigned to them through this, but this is not a very efficient solution, because the employees have to somehow
send a paper-based version or email to excel. 
Furthermore, at our company, everybody has been required to start using android smartphones, so they can follow what exercesie was given to them.

## The problem with this method
 * the user must find out from the table which task belongs to them.
 * you need to make a separate excel spreadsheet for each user which is not very practical.

## What are the expections about the application
 ### We want to be able to store
   * who is the client of the task
   * when the task was issued
   * when the task is due 
   * what condition the task is in
## The creation and modify
It is important to be able to create and modify a task.
The change is necessary even if the employee has completed the assignment and the principal reviews and failed to perform the assignment
or you did not complete the task well, you can change the deadline and status of the task. You can also search by name.
