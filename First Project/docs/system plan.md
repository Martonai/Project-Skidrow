# System plan
The plan of this system is, the user easily keep track of their tasks and donâ€™t forget to do it.
All in a transparent interface that does not pose any problems in managing the system.
It is important to the user easily adapt to interfaces therefore minimalist users
interface is given to the program.
Because the app is for Android only
we want to make it available in an application, it is not our intention to make it different, for example
Run on a device with an iOS operating system.
We want all ages to easily find their place in the use of the app and spread it as widely as possible.

## System purpose
The goal of this system is, to provides an up-to-date application, for the users, and thanks to, they can trace their tasks.
On the other hand, the system will replace the obsolete, paper-based system.
Employers can easily manage their employees, tasks and etc...
Employees can easily trace what tasks was given to them, what is the deadline, when the task was given to them.
