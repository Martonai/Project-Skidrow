# System plan
The plan of this system is, the user easily keep track of their tasks and donâ€™t forget to do it.
All in a transparent interface that does not pose any problems in managing the system.
It is important to the user easily adapt to interfaces therefore minimalist users
interface is given to the program.
Because the app is for Android only
we want to make it available in an application, it is not our intention to make it different, for example
Run on a device with an iOS operating system.
We want all ages to easily find their place in the use of the app and spread it as widely as possible.

## System purpose
The goal of this system is, to provides an up-to-date application, for the users, and thanks to, they can trace their tasks.
On the other hand, the system will replace the obsolete, paper-based system.
Employers can easily manage their employees, tasks and etc...
Employees can easily trace what tasks was given to them, what is the deadline, when the task was given to them.

## Database plan
![Database plan](https://github.com/Martonai/Project-Skidrow/blob/main/First%20Project/pictures/Database.PNG)

## Implementation plan
It will be written in Android Studio and Javascript.
These technologies are written in separate files as much as possible
for easier transparency.
You will be able to use the Backend section running
REST service methods, so you can upload and query data from the
from a database.


## Test plan
**Testing procedures:**

**Unit test:**

Wherever possible, it is necessary to test during development to ensure that
methods work properly. The
methods are ready when the test cases run without error
methods.

**Alfa test:**

The primary purpose of the test is to make the existing functions different
testing for compatibility with browsers and androids.
The procedure is successful if you have it in different browsers and on different androids
the various functions work properly.

**Beta test:**

This test is not performed by developers.
Browsers to test: Opera, Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari
Android systems to be tested: 6.0.0 (minimum) or later
Display dimensions to be tested: 1280x720 (minimum), 1366x768, 1920x1080

During testing, testing users can send feedback to
developers in the event of a problem / bug.
If an error occurs, the developers will fix it as soon as possible.

**Functions to be tested:**

**Backend Service**

You need to be able to connect to both web and android clients.
You must be able to serve multiple clients at the same time.
You need to be able to upload and retrieve database data.
It must be able to provide functions available on all interfaces.

**Android**
