# System plan
The plan of this system is, the user easily keep track of their tasks and donâ€™t forget to do it.
All in a transparent interface that does not pose any problems in managing the system.
It is important to the user easily adapt to interfaces therefore minimalist users
interface is given to the program.
Because the app is for Android only
we want to make it available in an application, it is not our intention to make it different, for example
Run on a device with an iOS operating system.
We want all ages to easily find their place in the use of the app and spread it as widely as possible.

## System purpose
The goal of this system is, to provides an up-to-date application, for the users, and thanks to, they can trace their tasks.
On the other hand, the system will replace the obsolete, paper-based system.
Employers can easily manage their employees, tasks and etc...
Employees can easily trace what tasks was given to them, what is the deadline, when the task was given to them.

## Abstract domain model

## Architectural plan
Frontend:

1. The design of the application is developed by Android studio.

Backend:

1. The system requires a database server, in this case we use MySql.
2. We use Java and php language for the development.

## Database plan
![Database plan](https://github.com/Martonai/Project-Skidrow/blob/main/First%20Project/pictures/Database.PNG)

## Implementation plan
It will be written in Android Studio and Javascript.
These technologies are written in separate files as much as possible
for easier transparency.
You will be able to use the Backend section running
REST service methods, so you can upload and query data from the
from a database.


## Test plan
**Testing procedures:**

**Unit test:**

Wherever possible, it is necessary to test during development to ensure that
methods work properly. The
methods are ready when the test cases run without error
methods.

**Alfa test:**

The primary purpose of the test is to make the existing functions different
testing for compatibility with browsers and androids.
The procedure is successful if you have it in different browsers and on different androids
the various functions work properly.

**Beta test:**

This test is not performed by developers.
Browsers to test: Opera, Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari
Android systems to be tested: 6.0.0 (minimum) or later
Display dimensions to be tested: 1280x720 (minimum), 1366x768, 1920x1080

During testing, testing users can send feedback to
developers in the event of a problem / bug.
If an error occurs, the developers will fix it as soon as possible.

**Functions to be tested:**

**Backend Service**

You need to be able to connect to both web and android clients.
You must be able to serve multiple clients at the same time.
You need to be able to upload and retrieve database data.
It must be able to provide functions available on all interfaces.

**Android**

**Registration interface:**

The registration interface must be available after the program is installed a
on the home screen next to the login option. If
user is not registered yet by clicking the button here
redirect to the registration interface. The appropriate data on this interface
by entering the confirmation button by clicking on the user
registration must be performed as described in the functional specification
go and then make the login available to the user.
If you enter incorrect registration information, you should receive an error message a
user.

**Login Interface:**

Checking the login / registration interface layout: Expected operation: a
according to the screen design in the functional specification
look regardless of screen size.
